# About project
This demo application was implemented to solve geometric puzzles using backtracking algorithm with additional "greedy" strategy to optimize practical computing time

# Implementation
To solve puzzle **Greedy Backtracking** algorithm was implemented

**How it works:**
  
First, we re-order shapes from largest to smallest to try most "greedy" placement first.
  
Next, every shape dimensional orientation varianst are pregenerated by clockwise rotation, horizontal and vertical flipping.
  
Then, algorithm recursively attempts to place each shape in a position on the grid and checks if the placement allows completing the puzzle.
  
**Pros**
  
Generally effective for exploring possible configurations and can find all solutions if they exist. Logic is simple and easy to test.
  
**Cons**
  
For large grids or many shapes, this can become computationally expensive.

# Computational complexity
So first we sort all shapes descending by size. This operation computational complexity is `O(n log n)`
  
Next, recursive backtracking algorithm is applied trying to place shapes into area. The computational complexity of implemented backtracking algorithm can be challenging to express precisely, as it depends on factors like the number of shapes and the layout of each shape.
  
But we can estimate an upper bound based on the possible placements and branches created in the recursive process.
  
Assuming there is P possible placements for each shape, considering recursive branching of backtracking algorithm the worst-case complexity for n shapes is `O(P<sup>n</sup>)`
  
So total computational upper-bound complexity is `O(n log n) + O(P<sup>n</sup>)`
  
In most scenarios initial sorting will greatly improve computational efficiency for small complexity increase.
