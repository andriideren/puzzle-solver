# About project
This demo application was implemented to solve geometric puzzles using backtracking algorithm with additional "greedy" strategy to optimize practical computing time

# Implementation
To solve puzzle **Greedy Backtracking** algorithm was implemented

**How it works:**
First, we re-order shapes from largest to smallest to try most "greedy" placement first.
Next, every shape dimensional orientation varianst are pregenerated by clockwise rotation, horizontal and vertical flipping.
Then, algorithm recursively attempts to place each shape in a position on the grid and checks if the placement allows completing the puzzle.

# Prerequisites
To build and run project [Node.js v18.18 or later](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm` are required

# How to run
To get started first clone repository using terminal
```
